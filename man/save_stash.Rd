}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Object to save}

\item{file.name}{Base file name for the saved object}

both. Using both can cause the file name to become very long.}

\item{uuid}{TRUE or FALSE. When TRUE, a uuid will be appended to
the \code{file.name}. It is recommended to use time.stamp OR uuid, not
both. Using both can cause the file name to become very long.}

\item{extension}{Extension to append to the file.}

\item{compression}{Accepts NULL for no compression, or 'gz' for gzip.}

\item{checksum}{Not being used right now.}

\item{save.fn}{Any function where the first argument is the object and the
second is the file path.}

\item{...}{Arguments to pass to \code{save.fn}.}
